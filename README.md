# Unit Testing Practice with unittest

This repository contains practice files for learning Python's `unittest` framework.

## Branch Structure
- **`main` branch**: Contains both implementation files and their test files
- **`practice` branch**: Contains only the implementation files (for practice writing tests)

## Practice Files Order & Learning Focus

Complete these exercises in order, focusing on different unittest concepts:

1. **calculator.py**  
   Research
   - Basic unittest structure
   - `assertEqual()` method
   - `assertRaises()` for exception testing

2. **auth.py**  
   Research
   - `setUp()` method for test initialization
   - 
3. **notif.py**  
   Research
   - Mocking
   - Verifying mock calls

4. **users.py**  
   Research
      -Patch
      -HTTP status codes / API Handling


## How to Practice
1. Switch to the `practice` branch
2. Create test files for each implementation
3. Compare your tests with the solutions in `main` branch
